Prompt for Modern UI/UX Web App Design

Objective:
Design a responsive web app for RilyGo G & AE (auto-service provider platform) that mirrors the mobile app’s functionality while leveraging web-centric UX patterns. Prioritize clarity, efficiency, and scalability for garage owners/managers.
Key Requirements:

    Audience & Role:

        Primary users: Garage owners, service managers, mechanics.

        Secondary: Drivers/staff (sub-accounts).

        Core needs: Booking management, service/product cataloging, real-time status updates, and analytics.

    Design Principles:

        Clean, professional aesthetic with a focus on data density (e.g., tables, dashboards).

        Mobile-first but optimized for larger screens (multi-column layouts, hover states).

        Consistent component library (buttons, modals, form fields) matching the mobile app’s brand.

    Core Modules to Adapt:

        Dashboard:

            Map view (Google Maps API integration) with garage location/status toggle (Open/Busy/Closed).

            Summary cards for today’s bookings, revenue, and pending actions.

        Booking Management:

            Kanban board or table with filters (Status: New/In Progress/Completed).

            Color-coded pills (match mobile’s 6-status legend).

            Bulk actions (e.g., accept/reject multiple bookings).

        Services & Products:

            CRUD interfaces with image upload, category trees, and bulk pricing edits.

        Driver Management:

            Table with sortable columns (name, role, last active).

            Inline editing for quick updates (no modal needed).

        Analytics:

            Interactive charts (bookings over time, revenue by service, customer ratings).

            Export to CSV/PDF.

    Web-Specific Enhancements:

        Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+A to select all bookings).

        Multi-tab support (e.g., open a booking details side-panel without losing context).

        Real-time updates (WebSocket notifications for new bookings).

    UI Inspirations:

        Reference: Shopify Admin (for scalable CRUD workflows), Calendly (for booking views), QuickBooks (for dashboards).

        Visuals:

            Primary color: RilyGo’s brand blue (or derive from mobile app).

            Data visualization: Use Light/Dark-friendly palettes (match mobile’s theme toggle).

    Deliverables:

        Figma/Adobe XD screens covering:

            Logged-in Dashboard (map + metrics).

            Booking Management (table/board view).

            Service/Product Catalog (with bulk edit mode).

            Driver Management (table + add/edit modals).

            Analytics (charts with date-range picker).

        Design system documentation (typography, spacing, interaction states).

    Success Metrics:

        User testing: 90%+ task completion rate for critical flows (e.g., accept a booking, add a service).

        <2s load time for key pages (optimize assets, lazy-load non-critical modules).
