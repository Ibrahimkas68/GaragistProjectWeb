UI/UX Design Prompt: Auto-Service Provider Admin Dashboard

Goal:
Design a modern, data-dense web dashboard for RilyGo G & AE that empowers garage owners to monitor operations, track earnings, and manage bookings efficiently.
Core Requirements:

    Audience:

        Garage owners/service managers (primary).

        Mechanics/staff (secondary, limited access).

        Key needs: Real-time revenue tracking, booking management, and operational flexibility.

    Design Principles:

        Professional, utilitarian aesthetic (dark/light mode compatible with RilyGo’s brand colors).

        Card-based layout for modular data (like your reference), but optimized for garage workflows.

        Interactive components: Hover tooltips, quick-edit fields, and dynamic filters.

    Dashboard Modules to Include:

        Header/Navigation (left sidebar or top bar):

            Logo + quick-access menu (Dashboard, Earnings, Bookings, Garage Schedule, Maintenance, Profile).

            Status toggle: "Open for Business" (green)/"Closed" (red) with edit button (sets operating hours).

        Hero Metrics (Top Row):

            Total Revenue (e.g., *$78,423 | +15.2% vs. last month*).

            Active Bookings (e.g., *32 | +5.2%*).

            Cars in Service (e.g., 12 | 3 pending diagnostics).

            Available Mechanics (e.g., *4/6*).

        Earnings Analytics:

            Interactive line chart (like your reference) showing:

                Daily/weekly/monthly revenue.

                Filter by service type (e.g., oil change, repairs).

                Overlay with operating hours (highlight peak revenue times).

        Booking Management:

            Kanban view or table with columns: New, In Progress, Completed.

            Color-coded status tags (match mobile app’s legend).

            Quick actions: "Assign to mechanic," "Mark as paid."

        Garage Schedule:

            Editable calendar showing:

                Operating hours (with edit button to adjust days/times).

                Mechanic shifts (drag-and-drop assignments).

                Booking slots (visual density indicator).

        Booking History:

            Filterable table with columns: Customer, Service, Date, Duration, Revenue, Status.

            Export to CSV/PDF.

        Car Maintenance Logs:

            List of vehicles with last service date, mileage, next due date.

            Alert badges for overdue maintenance.

    UI Inspirations & References:

        Layout: Card grid from your reference, but with garage-specific metrics.

        Data Viz: Use bar charts for service popularity, pie charts for payment methods.

        Interaction: Clickable rows (drill into booking details), bulk actions (e.g., archive old bookings).

    Deliverables (Figma/Adobe XD):

        Desktop screens:

            Dashboard overview (hero metrics + earnings chart).

            Booking management (Kanban/table view).

            Garage schedule (calendar with edit mode).

            Booking history (filterable table).

        Mobile-responsive wireframes (critical actions only).

        Design system: Buttons, form fields, alert styles.

    Tech Considerations:

        Real-time updates: WebSocket notifications for new bookings.

        API integrations: Calendar (Google Calendar API), payments (Stripe/PayPal).
